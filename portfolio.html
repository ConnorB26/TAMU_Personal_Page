                        This project was developed to fill a personal need for an app that combined note taking functionality with
                        the ability to see/edit/add events to the calendar, with extra functionality to input class information and
                        have class times and exams also be added to the calendar. Essentially, this app provides CRUD functionality
                        for notes, classes, and calendar events to manage everything a college student might need, all within a
                        single application instead of separate ones.

                        Not only was this a project done for practical purposes, it was also done so that I could learn about
                        Android application development along the way. Here's some of the stuff that I learned during development:
                        Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt-Dagger, Android Room, Software architecture styles (this project uses clean architecture),
                        and Software architecture design patterns (this project uses MVVM).

                        This site was designed as a personal project to learn React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and as a way to
                        formally display my most completed video game projects in a more professional manner. This project ended
                        up being purely front-end since I'm only just showing pictures, videos, text, etc., and have no need for
                        an internal database or any kind of back-end processing. However, it was still a great learning excerise
                        in a field I hadn't quite dabbled in yet and I plan to continually update this website as I make more games.

                        This project was developed as a part of the Texas A&M Howdy Hack hackathon in 2021 as a group of 3.
                        Being barely sophomores, we focused our time mainly on just learning the software and technology, such
                        as Git and Android Studio, and utilizing APIs, such as Google Maps and Spotify.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The main idea behind this app was to play a specific genre playlist depending on your location of the
                        Texas A&M - College Station campus. Although we didn't finish, we managed to get proper Spotify
                        authentication and connection that played a specified playlist and gave the user all of the normal
                        functionalities, such as skipping, pausing, etc.
