                    Howdy! My name is Connor Bowling and I'm a Junior Computer Science major with a minor in Psychology,
                    excited to learn more about the world of software development.

                <h2 class="tab_over1">Personal Background</h2>
                <p class="tab_over2">
                    I was born and raised in Carrollton, Texas (suburb north of Dallas), alongside my twin sister, Meredith.
                    I grew up playing ice hockey, which I still continue to play as a hobby, 12 years after I first started.
                    In addition to playing hockey, I have interests in watching hockey, making/playing video games, baking,
                    and building computers. After I graduate, I plan to get a job in the software development or game programming
                    industry, with a slight possibly of later pursuing a master's degree.
                </p>
    
                <h2 class="tab_over1">Academic Background</h2>
                <p class="tab_over2">
                    I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science, with a minor in Psychology. Over the previous few years,
                    I have worked on many different personal projects, gaining experience in the fields of game design, android
                    development, web development, and software development. As a result, I've learned a lot of different languages,
                    such as Kotlin, Java, C++, C\#, Visual Basic, and JavaScript, and different technologies and tools, such as
                    Git, Unity, Visual Studio, Photoshop, and more.
