# [TAMU Personal Page](https://people.tamu.edu/~connorb26/) - Connor Bowling's Initial Dive into Web Development

Welcome to the repository for my Texas A&M University Personal Page. This website was crafted as part of the CSCE 315 project, and it represents my initial foray into web development. Built exclusively with the foundational trinity of web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—this site stands as a testament to my early explorations in the realm of web design and development.

### Embracing the Basics

In a world increasingly reliant on frameworks and libraries, this project was a refreshing return to the basics. Without the crutches of modern frameworks, I faced challenges in ensuring cross-browser compatibility, crafting responsive designs, and implementing interactive features. Each line of code was meticulously written, ensuring that the site remained performant and bug-free.

This hands-on approach allowed me to grasp the intricacies and nuances of raw web development, laying a strong foundation upon which I've built my subsequent knowledge.

### Reflections & Key Takeaways

The TAMU Personal Page serves as a reminder of my humble beginnings in web development. While it might not boast the flashy features of contemporary websites, it encapsulates the essence of web development—creating something from nothing. The lessons I learned from this project, especially the importance of understanding core principles before moving on to abstractions, have been invaluable in my journey.

As I've progressed in my career, I've come to appreciate the importance of this foundational knowledge. While the tools and technologies will evolve, the principles remain constant, and this project was an essential step in internalizing those principles.
